  <h1>Warrior Cats Knowledge!</h1>
  <h2>Starting with an overview</h2>
  <h3>The Books</h3>
  <p>     Warrior Cats (Often called Warriors or WC for short) are just like cats that you or me own, but they live in the forest. They are divided into clans. During the book series, there are 5 clans, and a 6th is later discovered (Spoilers!). The 5 clans are Thunderclan, known for their strength, Shadowclan, known for their cunning, Riverclan (my personal favorite), known for their love of water and swimming abilities, Windclan, known for their speed, and Starclan, where the spirits of deceased cats go. Cats believe that the spirits of Starclan can send them prophecies, omens, help them in battle, and guide cats to their fate.</p>
  <p>
    There are many ranks of cats in a clan. These are: kits, apprentices, warriors, medicine cats, medicine cat apprentices, queens, deputies, leaders, and elders. Kits are kittens, and they are raised by queens, who birth and nurture the kits. Kits are turned into apprentices when they are 6 moons (months) old. At 12 moons (possibly later), apprentices become warriors. Medicine cats are the ones who take care of the sick and injured, and they recieve most of the prophecies. Med cat apprentices train to be medicine cats- what a surprise! Med cats and their apprentices get a special type of ceremony. We'll get into that later. Deputies are the co-leaders of the clan, as they will become leader once the old leader retires or dies. A warrior must have mentored at least 1 apprentice to become deputy. Leaders- well- lead their clan! they have a special ceremony where they are granted 9 lives. Elders are retired warriors or medicine cats- sometimes, if an apprentice is crippled or disabled, they will become a medicine cat or retire to the elder's den.
